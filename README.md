# TechLadies Bootcamp 4 - Technical Task Submission

## 1. Introduction

The TechLadies Bootcamp is a 12-week part-time accelerated learning program designed for women who wish to be professional programmers. You'll be guided by industry experts to create products for non-profit organizations. 30% of the TechLadies Bootcamp graduates found software-related jobs and internships.

For this year's bootcamp, two teams will be building web applications for NGOs using JavaScript technologies.

Visit [the bootcamp info page](http://www.techladies.co/techladies-bootcamp-4/) for more details.

## 2. The Technical Task

As part of the application process, you will need to complete a technical task. This will help us evaluate your technical capabilities before you can participate in the bootcamp. Don't let the technical task scare you! We are here to help you acquire the skills you need to complete the task with 3 prebootcamp workshops covering the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, and MongoDB and walking you through building a simple web application, as well as [a list of online resources below!](#resources)

There are two levels to this task: Level 1 and Level 2. Level 1 builds on top of Level 1 and is more complex. It's not mandatory to finish Level 2, and by no means does submitting only a Level 1 task preclude you from being chosen to participate in the bootcamp. But if you're capable of stretching yourself, try and have a go at Level 2! (And if you want even more of a challenge, you can tackle the bonus task!)

**Level 1**
Create todo list web application using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). This need only be a pure front-end application (there is no need to persist any data to a database; it's fine if your todos disappear when you refresh the page).

**Level 2**
Integrate your todo list web application with a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) server (backend) built with the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework, connected to a [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/) database. Your todos should be persisted to the database on the backend (if you refresh the page, any saved todos should be fetched from the backend server and still be visible).

**Bonus Task**
Try and deploy your web application to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/). (This will require knowing how to use a version control system such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/)). You can try this bonus task regardless of whether your're doing only Level 1 (deploy a pure front-end app), or Level 2 (deploy the full-stack application).

Remember, we have lots of [online resources](#resources) to help you out!

### The Deets

1. There should be an **About Me** page with a few paragraphs describe yourself and tell us why you want to be part of the TechLadies Bootcamp. You should include one image on this page (it can be a photo of yourself or anything else you like (cats are always a good option!))
2. There should be a **Todos** page where a user can add todos to a list, update existing todos, delete exisiting todos, and mark todos as done
3. There should be a **navigation bar** which allows you to navigate between the About Me and Todos page

***Hat tip:*** To stand out from the rest, you are highly encourage to not follow a single online tutorial to the T. Do read up on multiple resources to understand the concepts or google your way to finding how to accomplish what you want to code.

### Sample Application

Here is a link to a [sample technical task application](#some-link) (do note that it may take some time for the webpage to load). This is just to give you an idea of what you can build and what your final product might look like. *In no way are we expecting you to replicate this or do anything in a similar style (we don't want to limit your creativity!). However, it is also perfectly fine if you choose to do so.*

### Why is there a differentiation between Level 1 and Level 2?

This year's is the first time we're using JavaScript for the TechLadies Bootcamp (past bootcamps were conducted mainly in Ruby on Rails). This choice of technology presents some special challenges for a beginner's bootcamp. While JavaScript is a language popular with beginners (being, after all, the language of the web), the ecosystem is vast and has undergone a lot of churn (new frameworks/ways of doing things popping up every so often), and the language specification itself has grown a lot since its inception, which actually makes coming to grips with the whole thing rather more confusing for a beginner who's trying to self-learn her way through the multitudes of free online resources to build a simple web app, as compared to doing the same thing with Ruby on Rails.

We recognize this difficulty, and so are trying to adjust the technical task accordingly. Past technical tasks in Rails required applicants to build a whole full-stack web app in Rails (HTML views served by a backend web server that also dealt with persisting data to a database). However, we think that for this batch it's reasonable to ask applicants to try and focus on building a pure frontend web application in React (Level 1), before attempting to extend it by integrating with a backend NodeJS/Express server connected to a database (Level 2).

There are two teams for this bootcamp batch: one is building an application for the Sustainable Solutions Network Singapore (SSN Singapore), the other is building an application for [insert NGO here]. The applications for both teams will definitely involve frontend work in React, and the application for the SSN will also involve dealing with a backend server and a database. Because of this, we think it makes sense to tier the technical task like this. How much time and coverage we dedicate to teaching the backend and database side of things during the bootcamp will be adjusted based on the level of the participants that we are able to get.

## 3. Submitting Your Entry

1. After you have finished building your personal website, you will need to share the source code with us. You should do so:
- Through a link to a [Git repository](https://git-scm.com) on [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) (its free!)
- Through a link to a [Zip file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) or [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).

2. Visit [fill in url for new form here]
3. [change instructions accordingly] Under section 2, include the URL (web address) of where we can find your file.
